# Facedetection-and-Recognition-using-OpenCV
It's my first ever project in Computer Vision and it's name itself indicates that We can detect and recognize faces.

# Description 
I done a several programs that has their own functionality. The Facedetection.py used to detect the faces using the harcascade_frontalface classifier which i mentioned here. Training.py used to create a dataset of images that we manually given the id numbers and speified path to store the dateset. Then we run our classifier program to create our own classifier , an XML file inorder to recognize the faces. The Recognize.py use the custom classifier info and recognize the face and prints the name that we given manually to specified face over the top of the face rectangle.

# Installations
Install opencv using pip :
'''
pip install opencv-python
'''
the remaining packages and modules that we used so far are no need to install 

# Usage
The project is used for the attendance system and fraud detetction as well . We further working to implement this using Deep Learning algorithms.
